The AMR data available is the count of colistin resistant colonies in a pooled sample of faeces from a limited number of chickens at a precise date, in a given farm. For now, we consider, the collected faeces are those from  `n_chick_samp = 50` chickens, no matter the farm size, because the density of chickens is supposed to remain the same in all farms, and because the area of the sheeting used to collect the faeces does not change.

Here, we consider the Model 3 described in *Model_colistin_resistance.Rmd*.

We investigate the relationship between the proportion of "R" individual chickens (i.e. chickens carrying resistant bacteria, as opposed to "S" chickens) in the farm, and the proportion of resistant colonies described above.

## Definitions

As described in Model 3:

$$R_e = p_R.r_{sample} + p_S.s_{sample}$$
where:

* $R_e$ is the proportion of resistant colonies in the pooled sample
* $r_{sample} = \frac{R_{sample}}{S_{sample}+R_{sample}}$ is the proportion of "R" chickens among chickens whose faeces were collected
* $s_{sample} = \frac{S_{sample}}{S_{sample}+R_{sample}}$ is the proportion of "S" chickens among chickens whose faeces were collected
* $p_R$ (resp. $p_S$) is the proportion of the gut bacteria which are resistant in "R" (resp. "S") chickens
* $p_R \geq p_S$

Note there is a stochastic process during the sample of chickens whose samples are collected.

We define the ratio $Q$ as:

$$ Q = \frac{r_{farm}}{R_e} $$
where $r_{farm} = \frac{R_{farm}}{S_{farm}+R_{farm}}$ is the total proportion of "R" chickens on farm.

If $Q \approx 1$, it means the count of resistant colonies is a good proxy of the prevalence of resistance in chickens.

We load the *obs_process* and the *multiplot* functions:

```{r, warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
n_chick_samp = 50
source("model3_fcts.R")
```

```{r echo=F}
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL) {
  # Multiple plot function
  # Source: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)
  # 
  # ggplot objects can be passed in ..., or to plotlist (as a list of ggplot objects)
  # - cols:   Number of columns in layout
  # - layout: A matrix specifying the layout. If present, 'cols' is ignored.
  #
  # If the layout is something like matrix(c(1,2,3,3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE),
  # then plot 1 will go in the upper left, 2 will go in the upper right, and
  # 3 will go all the way across the bottom.

  library(grid)

  # Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist
  plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)

  numPlots = length(plots)

  # If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    # Make the panel
    # ncol: Number of columns of plots
    # nrow: Number of rows needed, calculated from # of cols
    layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
                     ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
  }

  if (numPlots==1) {
    print(plots[[1]])

  } else {
    # Set up the page
    grid.newpage()
    pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))

    # Make each plot, in the correct location
    for (i in 1:numPlots) {
      # Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
      matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))

      print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
                                      layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
    }
  }
}
```

We define a function *plot_Q* for plotting the mean value of $Q$ (out of 100 simulations) depending on $p_R$ and $p_S$.

```{r}
plot_Q = function(S_farm, R_farm, val_pS=seq(0,1,0.05), val_pR=seq(0,1,0.05), n_chick_samp=50){

  sens_an = as.data.frame(matrix(NA, length(val_pS)*length(val_pR), 3))
  colnames(sens_an) = c("val_pS", "val_pR", "val_proxy")
  sens_an$val_pS = rep(val_pS, length(val_pR))
  sens_an$val_pR = as.vector(matrix(rep(val_pR, length(val_pS)), length(val_pS), length(val_pR), byrow=T))
  
  for(pS in val_pS){
    for(pR in val_pR[which(val_pR >= pS)]){
      Q_rat = c()
      for (iter in 1:100){
        Q_rat = c(Q_rat, obs_process(c(S_farm, R_farm), list(n_chick_samp, pS, pR)))
      }
      sens_an$val_proxy[which((sens_an$val_pS == pS) & (sens_an$val_pR == pR))] = (R_farm /(S_farm + R_farm))/mean(Q_rat)
    }
  }
  sens_an$val_proxy[which(sens_an$val_proxy > 2)] = 2
  
  p = ggplot(data = sens_an, aes(x=val_pS, y=val_pR))
  p = p + ggtitle(paste0("Value of Q with S=",S_farm," and R=",R_farm))
  p = p + xlab("pS")
  p = p + ylab("pR")
  p = p + geom_tile(aes(fill = val_proxy))
  p = p + scale_fill_gradient2("Q", low = rgb(1,0,0), mid = rgb(1,1,1), high = rgb(0,0,1), midpoint = 1, na.value = rgb(0,0,0))
  p
  
  return(p)
}
```
*Note*: The value of $Q$ is limited to 2 for illustration efficiency.

## Impact of $p_R$ and $p_S$ on the value of $Q$

By definition, $p_R$ and $p_S$ affect $Q$.

For instance, if $R_{farm} = 60$ and $S_{farm} = 40$:

```{r}
plot_Q(S_farm=40, R_farm= 60)
```

## Mean value of $Q$ depending on the prevalence of resistance

Here, we consider a fixed farm size of 100 chickens.

We investigate how the mean value of $Q$ changes with the proportion of "R" chickens (20%, 50% and 80%).

```{r}
p1 = plot_Q(S_farm=80, R_farm=20)
p2 = plot_Q(S_farm=50, R_farm=50)
p3 = plot_Q(S_farm=20, R_farm=80)

multiplot(p1,p2,p3)

```

The only values of $p_R$ and $p_S$ that ensure a value of $Q \approx 1$ no matters the prevalence are $p_R = 1$ and $p_S = 0$ (which makes sense).

## Variability of $Q$ depending on the farm size

We define a function *plot_sd_Q* that is similar to *plot_Q* excepted it plots the Standard Deviation of Q.

```{r}
plot_sd_Q = function(S_farm, R_farm, val_pS=seq(0,1,0.05), val_pR=seq(0,1,0.05), n_chick_samp=50){

  sens_an = as.data.frame(matrix(NA, length(val_pS)*length(val_pR), 3))
  colnames(sens_an) = c("val_pS", "val_pR", "val_proxy")
  sens_an$val_pS = rep(val_pS, length(val_pR))
  sens_an$val_pR = as.vector(matrix(rep(val_pR, length(val_pS)), length(val_pS), length(val_pR), byrow=T))
  
  for(pS in val_pS){
    for(pR in val_pR[which(val_pR >= pS)]){
      Q_rat = c()
      for (iter in 1:100){
        Q_rat = c(Q_rat, obs_process(c(S_farm, R_farm), list(n_chick_samp, pS, pR)))
      }
      sens_an$val_proxy[which((sens_an$val_pS == pS) & (sens_an$val_pR == pR))] = sd(Q_rat)
    }
  }

  p = ggplot(data = sens_an, aes(x=val_pS, y=val_pR))
  p = p + ggtitle(paste0("Value of Q with S=",S_farm," and R=",R_farm))
  p = p + xlab("pS")
  p = p + ylab("pR")
  p = p + geom_tile(aes(fill = val_proxy))
  p = p + scale_fill_gradient2("Q sd", low = rgb(1,1,1), mid = rgb(1,1,0.5), midpoint = 0.03, na.value = rgb(0,0,0))
  p
  
  return(p)
}
```

With a same prevalence of 60%, we test several farm sizes: 100, 1000, 10000.

```{r}
p1 = plot_sd_Q(S_farm=40, R_farm=60)
p2 = plot_sd_Q(S_farm=400, R_farm=600)
p3 = plot_sd_Q(S_farm=4000, R_farm=6000)

multiplot(p1,p2,p3)

```

The variability of $Q$ seems to increase with the farm size, which makes sense regarding the fixed sample size (`n_chick_samp = 50`).
